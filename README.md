# Currencio

## Description
Currencio is a currency converter created by [Dave Gulati](https://davegulati.com/) as a small side project. The objective of this project was to soldify my understanding of [React](https://react.dev/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) by building something practical.

## Disclaimer
Currencies, values and conversions may be incorrect and/or outdated. Please do not base any financial decisions on outputs generated by Currencio. This is just a proof of concept.
